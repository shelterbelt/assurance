## What Is Assurance

Assurance is a cross-platform, client-only application written in Java that leverages both Spring and Hibernate with a Swing-based UI.

At it's core, it is a tool to comprehensively compare and optionally synchronize the contents of two or more directories.

## License

Assurance is released under the [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

See the LICENSE.txt file for the formal license specification.

## Prerequisites

The following tools need to be installed to build Assurance:

* Apache Maven 3.2.3 \[[download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)\]
* Apache Ant 1.9.3 \[[download](https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi)\]
* Oracle Java JDK 1.8u20 \[[download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/index-jsp-138363.html)\]

The Maven configuration will download and install the appropriate versions of the following tools:

* Spring Framework
* Hibernate
* JUnit
* H2
* Apache Commons
* Apple Java Extensions
* SLF4J
* Log4J

The following dependencies are required to run binary distributions of Assurance on Windows:

* Oracle Java JRE 1.8u20 \[[download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/index-jsp-138363.html)\]

The Mac distributions of Assurance package the appropriate JRE with the application bundle.  Windows distributions require the appropriate JRE is installed prior to starting the application.

## Building and Packaging

Assurance uses Maven as its primary build and dependency management system.  

To build the application:

*Mac*	

	cd <project root>/assurance
	mvn clean package -Pdevelopment
	
*Windows*

	cd <project root>\assurance
	mvn clean package -Pdevelopment-windows

To run the unit tests:

*Mac*	

	cd <project root>/assurance
	mvn clean test -Pdevelopment
	
*Windows*

	cd <project root>\assurance
	mvn clean test -Pdevelopment-windows

To package the application for internal release:

*Mac*	

	cd <project root>/assurance
	mvn clean package -Pintrelease
	
*Windows*

	cd <project root>\assurance
	mvn clean package -Pintrelease-windows

To package the application for release:

*Mac*	

	cd <project root>/assurance
	mvn clean package -Prelease
	
*Windows*

	cd <project root>\assurance
	mvn clean package -Prelease-windows
	
## IDE

Assurance was developed using Spring Tool Suite 3.6.1.  Project files are included with the distribution.

## Acknowledgments

Assurance includes a modified version of the 

	com.ibatis.common.jdbc.ScriptRunner 

class from the iBATIS Apache project.

## Disclaimers

Assurance was built and tested primarily on a Mac environment.  The Windows implementation has not been tested/vetted nearly to the degree the Mac version has.  Linux viability exists but is essentially untested.
